# DiscordMultiPlayer
A discord link bot for LMP/DMP

To add the plugin to your server, place DiscordConnector.dll, and either DMPDiscord.dll or LMPDiscord.dll inside your server's Plugins/ folder.
The next time you start the server it will generate a linkkey.txt file in the Plugins/ folder which contains the info needed to link the bot.
The link key is also written to the server console as it is starting.

To add the bot to your discord server, use this link: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=657155482187726858&permissions=101376&scope=bot
In the channel you wish to link, type '@DiscordMultiPlayer link' and it will tell you to DM the link key.
